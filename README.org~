This repository aims to store activity 1 of the discipline of High Performance Computing (CMP270) from UFRGS, taught by professors Phillipe A. O. Navaux and Lucas M. Schnorr.
Activity 1 consists of developing the Julia set codes in a sequential version, later in a parallel version with MPI.
The parallel version will have two implementations, one decomposing the data into 1-D and a second decomposing into 2-D.
The activity follows the SimGrid tutorial, which can be accessed at this link https://simgrid.github.io/SMPI_CourseWare//01_topic/

Executions are performed using SMPI and SimGrid.

The results of the runs are located in the results folder and the source codes are in the source folder.

About Julia Set:

Julia is a fractal, i.e., an object that is self-similar across scales (you "zoom in" and you keep seeing similar structures / features). It is a generalization of the famous Mandelbrot set, which adorns many T-shirts (search for "Mandelbrot zoom" for psychedelic videos).

The particular Julia set that we compute here is defined as follows. Given a point in the 2-D complex plane, we compute the series defined as:

z0 = z
zn + 1 = zn 2 + c
where c = -0.79 + i * 0.15. Different values ​​of c lead to different images, and we know many values ​​that produces "pretty" images.
The color of a pixel corresponding to point z is determined based on the number of iterations before the modulus of zn is above 2 (or until a maximum number of iterations is reached).

Not to worry, code is provided for you for the above. However, feel free to tweak it to create different images and to find out more about Julia sets.
